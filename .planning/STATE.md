# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-08)

**Core value:** A single command brings the physical rig to the exact state described in the config repo — no guessing, no manual knob-hunting.
**Current focus:** v1.2 archived — planning next milestone

## Current Position

All phases complete — v1.2 milestone archived 2026-06-08.

Progress: [████████████████████] 100% (13/13 phases)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 26

## Decisions

### Phase 10 decisions

- **Device list order = signal chain** — no separate signal-chain.yaml; the devices list position defines chain order
- **Presets inline** — each device entry carries its own presets; parsed to correct model type
- **Scenes extracted from controller config** — controller holds scenes with bank/switch; loader extracts `presets`/`description`/`tags` to `Scene` model; controller-specific fields stay in device config
- **`config.type` is the entry point key** — plugin dispatch uses `config.type` (e.g. `"midi"`, `"chase_bliss"`), while device-level `type` is the `DeviceType` enum (`"digital"`, `"analog"`, `"modeler"`, `"controller"`)
- **`composes` is optional controller metadata** — validated against device IDs; not used for graph ordering (yet)

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Plugin | `generate_mc6` should read scenes from MC6 config instead of `Rig.scenes` | resolved — removed in Phase 12 | Phase 10 |
| Plugin | MC6 apply could leverage `composes` data | resolved — removed in Phase 12 | Phase 10 |
