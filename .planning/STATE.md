## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Decouple engine before adding plan command — clean seam makes plan and apply independently testable
- Plan command is read-only (no MIDI) — apply is the explicit commit step
- Three narrow Protocols preferred over one fat Protocol wrapping ApplyContext
- Phase 3 replanned (2026-06-04): graph-based domain model + plugin registry replaces the original Plan Command phase; Plan Command moved to Phase 5

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
