# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-04)

**Core value:** A single command brings the physical rig to the exact state described in the config repo — no guessing, no manual knob-hunting.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — cba-tech-debt-cleanup

## Current Position

Phase: 3
Plan: Not started
Status: Executing Phase 01

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Decouple engine before adding plan command — clean seam makes plan and apply independently testable
- Plan command is read-only (no MIDI) — apply is the explicit commit step
- Three narrow Protocols preferred over one fat Protocol wrapping ApplyContext

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research open question: exit code values for `rig plan` — confirm whether `1` = changes, `2` = error before Phase 3 implementation
